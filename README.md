# [Slay Stats](http://www.slaystats.com)

A website to view statistics and analyze gameplay from your personal Slay the Spire runs.

I decided to make this since:

* Slay the Spire does not publish most of the statistics it stores
* I could not find a great tool to analyze my runs

 The tools I found fell into one of these categories:

* Unmaintained
* More complex to use than simply uploading files
* Hard to modify

An open source and serverless website written in TypeScript may mitigate these issues.
